HOMEWORK FOR THIS WEEKEND:
Currently your database doesn't have a foreign key relationship set up to relate the Users and Organizations Tables. FIX THAT!
(You will have to drop your database and create it again. GET USED TO DOING THAT. We'll be doing it a lot.)
After that's done, finish your USER CRUDDA Functions and Routes
THEN do the same thing for the Organizations table!

you can use this as your reference to understand how the routes work. DO NOT just copy and paste my code.
Do your best to understand how each function works!
